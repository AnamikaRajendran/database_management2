# database_management2

This repository is dedicated to my coursework for Database Management Course 2. It contains my assignments, projects, and code related to database concepts and implementations.

A key focus of this repo is a stock market analysis using SQLite, where I store, query, and analyze stock data to gain insights into market trends. The code includes SQL queries, data processing scripts, and analytical techniques to work with stock market datasets efficiently.

This repo serves as a structured collection of my learning and practical applications throughout the course.
